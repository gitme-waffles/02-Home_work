## Mock Portfolio


This application is a mock portfolio with 3 images that when clicked
take you to a deployed [website](https://gitme-waffles.github.io/01-Home_work/) (from the previous project).

The nav bar has 3 buttons that when clicked take you to the corrosponding section within the page.

The contact links take you to my github page

The layout is responsive to the size of the screen

## As I am just starting as a developer I have no other work to reference. So I thought using the same project as placeholders for now would show that the site works if it had more content.
